# truthbrush
Truthbrush is an API client for Truth Social.

Currently, this tool can:

* Search for users, statuses, groups, or hashtags
* Pull a user's statuses
* Pull the list of "People to Follow" or suggested users
* Pull "trending" hashtags
* Pull "trending" Truth posts
* Pull ads
* Pull a user's metadata
* Pull the list of users who liked a post
* Pull the list of comments on a post
* Pull "trending" groups
* Pull list of suggested groups
* Pull "trending" group hashtags
* Pull posts from group timeline

Truthbrush is designed for academic research, open source intelligence gathering, and data archival. It pulls all data from the publicly accessible API.

## Installation

From PyPi:

```sh
pip install truthbrush
```

From git:

* To install it, run `pip install git+https://github.com/stanfordio/truthbrush.git`

From source:

* Clone the repository and run `pip3 install .`. Provided your `pip` is setup correctly, this will make `truthbrush` available both as a command and as a Python package.

After installation, you will need to set your Truth Social username and password as environmental variables.

`export TRUTHSOCIAL_USERNAME=foo`

`export TRUTHSOCIAL_PASSWORD=bar`

If you encounter login issues, you can instead extract your login token from the truth:auth Local Storage store and export it in `TRUTHSOCIAL_TOKEN`.

You may also set these variables in a `.env` file in the directory from which you are running Truthbrush.

### Public mode (no credentials)

Some Truth Social endpoints are readable without authentication. To run Truthbrush against only those endpoints, pass `--no-auth` on the CLI or construct the client with `require_auth=False`:

```sh
truthbrush --no-auth trends
truthbrush --no-auth user realDonaldTrump
```

```py
from truthbrush import Api

api = Api(require_auth=False)
print(api.trending())
```

Endpoints that require authentication will return an API error (typically HTTP 401) when called in public mode. Which endpoints are publicly accessible is determined by Truth Social and may change without notice.
